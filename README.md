C++ Development
</h1>

The Upskill program C++ Development is specifically designed to provide a structured and comprehensive set of programming skills, delivered through a series of four practically oriented courses.

The ultimate goal of this Upskill program is not only to provide a solid theoretical foundation but also to prepare participants for real-world project requirements, reinforcing their understanding of the practical value of their C++ programming knowledge and skills.

### [1. Programming Basics with C++](./01-cpp-basics/cpp-basics.md)
The first course, "Programming Basics with C++", offers participants the opportunity to master the initial stages of programming. This includes learning how to work with integrated development environments (IDEs), defining variables, managing data, using operators, working with the console interface, and applying conditional statements and loops.
### [2. C++ Fundamentals](./02-cpp-fundamentals/cpp-fundamentals.md)
The next course, "C++ Fundamentals", emphasizes the importance of data structures by covering arrays, functions, linear containers, and string handling specific to C++.
### [3. C++ Advanced](./03-cpp-advanced/cpp-advanced.md)
Continuing with "C++ Advanced", participants will build on their C++ knowledge by focusing on dynamic memory management, the use of associative containers, container adapters, and working with multidimensional arrays.
### [4. C++ OOP](./04-cpp-oop/cpp-oop.md)
In the final course, "C++ OOP", dedicated to object-oriented programming with C++, participants will expand their skills through enhanced practice in creating classes and objects, exploring constructors and destructors, applying inheritance and polymorphism, and refining code organization and structure in large project environments.
